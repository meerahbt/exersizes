What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute

(define (sqrt-iter guess x) 
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x) 
    guess 
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

new-if predicate then-clause else-clause

So in this case the predicate is (sqrt-iter guess x)
               the then-clase is (guess)
               and the else is (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)

This means that it will first check if the guess is 'good enough'
if yes then it will give you the value of the guess (x), else it will
improve the guess.
